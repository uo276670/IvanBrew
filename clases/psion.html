<h2>The Psion</h2>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
            I like the idea of psions being focused on the mind, specifically the
            part of concentration while being based on low hp type of class
        </p>
        <p>
            I like the Idea of having a limited ability of concentrating on 2 Spells
            at the shame time at lvl 5 but they receive x2 damage and if they lose
            concentration they lose both spells
        </p>
        <p>
            I also like the Idea of having special things to do WHEN you are concentrating
            or another enemy is concentrating
        </p>

    <li>
    <h2>LvL1: Psionics</h2>
        <p>
            The way you use your brain and mind to perform magical feats. You know the Mage Hand cantrip,
            it is invisible when you cast it and it doesnt count towards the amount of cantrips known. 
            Also, when you cast a spell from your psionic spell list, you can forgo verbal and somatic 
            components of the spell
        </p>
        <p>
            A psionic spell is any spell learnt directly through this class or subclass. If you learn
            spell by any other mean like Feat:Magic Initiate, those spells doesnt count as psionic
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to maintain you concentration on the spells you have to make an INT save when you 
            take damage with DC10 or the amount of damage you got halved, whichever is bigger.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since your mind is the focus of your magic, you cannot cast spells from your list of psionic
            spells if your mind is being mendled with.
        </p>
        <p>
            Conditions that disable your magic: charmed, frightened, incapacitated, stunned, unconscious 
            or under the effects of the spell "calm emotions"
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <h2>LvL1: Mind Fatigue</h2>
        <p>
            Multiple features of this class requires to spend a lot of physical and mental energy to
            perform. This is shown with the Mind Fatigue.
        </p>
        <p>
            When a feature requires you to suffer Mind Fatigue, choose and expend one of your remaining 
            hit dice. Roll it. You lose that die and take damage equal to the result. This damage 
            ignores resistance, immunity, and temporary hit points, and cannot be reduced or avoided 
            in any way.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <h2>LvL1: Select your intellect (Subclase)</h2>
        <p>
            I want most clases to have some bonuses while concentrating on spells. Concentration as the main idea.
            Each class will give up to 4 spells across the levels.
        </p>
        <p>
            Intellect of the mind: One that is based on detect thoughts and you can do some stuff with it like: detect thoughs on an enemy 
            that is concentratinh on a spell to make that spell yours or cast spells inside its head or do damage
            from inside. Like witch bolt, you get linked and can each turn fuck him up
        </p>
        <p>
            Intelect of the forces: telekinesis, You move yourself, throw things at enemies, and throw enemies, dnd spells like
            telekinesis, catapult, levitate, flight adn such.
        </p>
        <p>
            Intelect of divination: You can read a little bit into the furute, spells that can tell you the future, and the 
            ability to ask the master what X character will do on its turn. (of course this can change if something
            makes the character change) see into 6 secs into the future. You can go to the start of your turn in case
            you miss or something
        </p>
        <p>
            Intellect of the Puppeteer: Mind controll and mind fuck. Damage to the mind, controll others etc
        </p>
        <p>
            Intellect of the body: While concentrating you add your Int mod to your ac and gain a fighting style and prof with
            two weapon types of your choice, Multiattack lvl 5
        </p>

    </li>
    <li>
    <h2>LvL2: Mind Amplification</h2>
        <p>
            While you are concentrating on one or more spells, you get bonuses depending on the number 
            of spells. a spell, you get +1AC per your spells deal an extra 1D6 of its damage type per 
            spell being simultaneaosly concentrated.
        </p>
        <p>
            For each spell you are concentrating on, you get +1AC and damaging spells have their damage
            increased by 1D6.
        </p>
        <p>
            The damage increase is part of the spell, its not a separate instance of damage. Then the 1D6
            shares damage type with the spell. You can think of this like upcasting a spell so that it
            deals more damage.
        </p>
        <p>
            Concentrate on 1 spell = 1d6 extra damage and +1AC. Concentrate on 3 spell = 3d6 extra
            damage and +3AC
        </p>      
    </li>
    <li>
    <h2>LvL3: Heightened Mind</h2>
        <p>
            By means of forcing your mind, you can concentrate better. When you cast a spell that
            requires concentration while you are already concentrating on another spell, you can give yourself
            Mind Fatigue to maintain concentration on both spells at the same time. 
        </p>
        <p>
            All damage you take is increased by 1D6 while you concentrate on more than one spell. In 
            case you lose concentration, both spells end inmediately and you take 1d6 psychic damage.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <h2>LvL4: Ability score upgrade</h2>
        <p>
            You gain an ability score upgrade or a feat. You gain the same benefict at levels 8, 12, 16, 19
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <h2>LvL6: Brainstorm</h2>
        <p>
            You can use your bonus action to end your concentration on all spells to deal damage.
            You can select a single target at 60ft, or you can make a sphere of 5ft centered at yourself.
            All target creatures make a save
        </p>
        <p>
            The damage is a number of D6 equal to the number of spell being concentrated on 
            simultaneously
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that cantrips count as level 0 spells and therefore do not contribute towards this 
            feature's damage. A  creature that doesnt pass this check takes half damage. 
            Choose either force damage (targets make a Constitution save) or psychic damage 
            (targets make an Intelligence save) when you activate this feature.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <h2>LvL10: Complex mind</h2>
        <p>
            Choose one skill from the Psion class skill list in which you are proficient. 
            You gain expertise in that skill, doubling your proficiency bonus for any 
            ability check you make with it.
        </p>
        <p>
            You are immune to being charmed, and your thoughts cannot be read by any 
            means, including spells such as detect thoughts or telepathy. Additionally, 
            creatures cannot target you with effects that would read, manipulate, or 
            alter your thoughts or emotions unless you choose to allow it.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <h2>LvL14: Ascended mind</h2>
        <p>
            You can use your Heightened Mind feature to concentrate on 3 spells at the same time.
            When you concentrate on 3 spells, your movement speed is halved and, you must get Mind Fatigue 
            at the start of each of your turns
