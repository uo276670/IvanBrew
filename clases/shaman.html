<h2>The shaman</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
        Shamans are magical users who perform old magic. They channel nature through their
        bodies, thats why their main characteristic is CONSTITUTION.

        in the form of expending hit die

        <h4>LvL1: Ritual Casting</h4>
        <p>
            Allows you to perform Rituals of magic using your body as the
            focus. You can cast Rituals as many times you like.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you take the ritual action, you begin concentrating
            on your ritual and need to keep your concentration for the
            whole duration of its performance in order to complete it.
        </p>
        <p>
            On your next turns you need to spend your action to continue
            your ritual until it is completed. When you perform a rite 
            during combat, the amount of actions needed to perform 
            the ritual can be seen on the rite table
        </p>
        <p>
            Besides regular concentration rules.
            Moving, or being forced to move while you perform a rite
            will end your concentration.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you lose your concentration or you cannot use your action
            to continue the ritual, the rite will fail losing all the
            progress towards performing the ritual spell

<h3>Spells</h3>
    <p>
        You have the ability of performing rituals to invoke magic. These rituals do not any
        spell slot. In order to cast a ritual you have to spend twice the casting time 
        while concentrating on the spell standing still
    </p>
    <p>
        If you move or are forced to move, the ritual ends. Breaking your concentration while
        performing the ritual also cancels it.
    </p>
    <p>
        You know a number of rituals equal to your proficiency bonus. CON is your ability to
        perform those rituals. The rituals you perform can be upgraded using the rite abilities
    </p>
    <p>
        Every time you perform a healing ritual of any kind, you have to spend a number of 
        your hit die equal to your ritual power or gain one level of exhaustion in case 
        you dont have any hit dice left
