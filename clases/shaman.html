<h2>The shaman</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
        Shamans are magical users who perform old magic. They channel nature through their
        bodies, thats why their main characteristic is CONSTITUTION.
    </p>
    <p>
        They can only fight up close or perform old rituals that sometimes tax their bodies
        in the form of expending hit die
    </p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <h4>Lvl1: Healing remedy</h4>
        <p>
            You can help others heal thanks to themselves. You can spend
            one action so that one creature of your choice you treat can
            use one of their hit die to recover health. They heal for
            a throw of their hit die + your medicine modifier
        </p>
    </li>
    <li><h4>LvL1: Ritual Casting</h4>
        <p>
            Allows you to perform Rituals of magic using your body as the
            focus. You can cast Rituals as many times you like but 
            cannot be upcasted.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you take the ritual action, you begin performing
            your ritual and need to keep doing it for the
            whole duration in order to complete it.
        </p>
        <p>
            On your next turns you need to spend your action to continue
            your ritual until it is completed. When you perform a rite 
            during combat, the amount of actions needed to perform 
            the ritual can be seen on the rite table
        </p>
        <p>
            If you move, are forced to move or you cannot use your action
            to continue the ritual, the rite will fail losing all the
            progress towards performing the ritual spell
        </p>
        <p>
            You select a number of rites from your spell list acording to the
            Rites Known column on the table. The spells you choose must be
            at most of the level shown in Rite Power column.
            You can spend time during your short or long rest contacting
            the spiritual forces to change the rites you have prepared
        </p>
    </li>
    <li><h4>LvL1: Fighing style</h4>
        <p>You get the following beneficts
        <ul>
            <li>You learn Shillelagh and obtain club and quarterstafs proficiency</li>
            <li>Gain Unarmed fighting</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
    </li>
    <li><h4>LvL3: Subclass</h4>
        <p>
            Subclass: Totem, elemental, healer
            Each subclass gives some free rituals that do not count towards your ritual number
        </p>
        <ul>
        <li><p><h4>Totem subclass:</h4>
            IDEAS: think that creating a totem is itself the ritual so that other buffs from the main class can stack
            totems give buffs to the rest of stuff you do
            allies can also benefict from this

            You get some rites always prepared through this subclass. But these rites can only perform on totems

                    lvl 3 Totemancy: You can create totems to store succesful rites. You can have a number
                    of totems active at the same time equal to your proficiency bonus. Your totems

                    others or left at specific locations. You know the general location of each of
                    your active totems. Each totem has 12HP

                <li>
                    lvl 6 Spiritual revuke: When one of your totems or a creature carrying one of your totems receive

                </li>
                <li>
                    lvl 10 Ancient Amplification ritual: Being close to your creations gives you special boons.
                    Any ally being within 5ft of one of your totems (you included) get +1 to AC, attack rolls,

                    lvl 14 Great totemancy: You can create great totems that ward off evil. You give offerings
                    to try and speak with the spirits in search of aid like some little boons
                    and you cannot be surprised while sleeping under its veil. 
                    Performing a ritual under a great totem makes rituals take 1 less action to complete and you 
                    get a free enhanced ritual d12
                    You need 1D12 days to build one.

            IDEAS: I really like the idea of moving a little bit while doing the ritual
            I like the idea of having some elemental stuff, control elements cantrip
            Maybe also alowing to surround yourself with some damagin elemental area using your hit die
            (earth(difficult terrain), wind(pushing), fire(damage))

            Make it so that you can use your bonus action while casting a ritual to heal 1D12 using your hit die
            You can use one short rest to heal a creature from aflictions 
            (lesser/greater restoration/lift curse/ etc during camp) the ide ais having a list of spells you
