<h2>The shaman</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
        Shamans are magical users who perform old magic. They channel nature through their
        bodies, thats why their main characteristic is CONSTITUTION.
    </p>
    <p>
        They can only fight up close or perform old rituals that sometimes tax their bodies
        in the form of expending hit die
    </p>
    <p>
        A shaman has to think in advance since they need at best 2 turns to cast any spell. When
        they perform a new ritual they lost the concentration and effects of the previous rite, 
        so it is important that they manage a spell untill it is dismised to then start a new rite
    </p>

        <h4>LvL1: Ritual Casting</h4>
        <p>
            Allows you to perform Rituals of magic as many times as you want.
            Your ability for these rituals is CON.
        </p>
        <p>
            Rituals take a long time to make. When you take the ritual action,
            the next turns you will be stuck finishing the ritual. Each turn
            after you take the ritual action, you can use your action to continue
            the ritual. When you continue the ritual this way, you throw one D12.
            The ritual will be done the moment you add up a number greater that or
            equal to tree times the ritual level. 
        </p>
        <p>
            E.G you are a level 5 shaman and take the Perform a Rite action to 
            perform a Thunderwave ritual. Since you are lvl 5, the thunderwave will 
            be level 3. Then you will need a 9 to end the ritual. On your next turn
            you take the Continue Ritual action, throw a D12 and get a 4. On your
            next turn you do the same and get a 6. The total sum is 10 so the ritual
            is completed and Thunderwave is casted
        </p>
        <p>
            When you perform a ritual, you gain concentration on it and cannot
            move while performing the ritual. In case you decide to move, or are
            forced to move, you lose the concentration
        </p>
        <p>
            When you use a ritual that heals a creature in any way, you have to spend
            a number of your hit die equal to your rite power. In case you dont have
            enough hit die left, you gain a level of exhaustion.
        </p>
        <h4>LvL1: Shamanic divination</h4>
        <p>
            You know the ritual Augury
        </p>
        <h4>LvL1: Fighing style</h4>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Spirit: You learn Shillelagh and obtain club and quarterstafs proficiency</li>
                <li>Earth: Gain Unarmed fighting</li>

    <li>
        <h4>LvL3: Subclass</h4>

            Each subclass gives some free rituals that do not count towards your ritual number
