    <h2>What I dont like</h2>
    <p>
        All magic feels the same regardless of where it comes from. I would love for each class
        to have a different relationship with how it all works.
    </p>
<h2>What I like</h2>
    <p>
    I feel that the general way magic works, with the components and concentrations and 
    rituals spell slots, etc... it is all very understandable and I like how you are able
    to go from one class to another and more or less understand how it works
    </p>
    <p>
        If we take that conceps and make different classes be more focused on some part in order
        to make them feel cooler
    </p>
    <h3>Examples</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Shamans that are more focused on rituals. And creating buffs. They spend
                multiple turns casting a single very powefull spell
            </li>
            <li>Wizards can create, mix and learn most
                things and are more or less a master of all trades regarding magic.
            </li>
            <li>
                Warloks are spell shotguns but the pact should be a bigger part of the them.
                I would make them have spell slots equal to proficiency and more buffs from
                their patrons
            </li>
            <li>
                Bards are based on multiple target effects with all that music and poetry
                and all that.
            </li>
            <li>
                Paladins have lots of concentration spells
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These are my main ideas. But in general I think that each class should have very 
            specific gameplay mechanics and focus and goals during a fight that other classes
            dont really care about that much
