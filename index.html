<h2>What is this?</h1>
<p>
    I just wanted to share my opinions and have them organizen on a html
    page in order to practice a little bit with the technology
</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
    I just always felt that D&D classes felt very similar. This is great 
    for learning the game and knowledge from one class can very easily 
    change to another of the similar type
</p>
<p>
    My general idea with this proyect is to create different classes
    that are more distinc from one another and have their own way to play.
