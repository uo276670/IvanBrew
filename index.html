    <h2>What is this?</h1>
    <p>
        I just wanted to share my opinions and have them organizen on a html
        page in order to practice a little bit with the technology
    </p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        I just always felt that D&D classes felt very similar. This is great 
        for learning the game and knowledge from one class can very easily 
        change to another of the similar type
    </p>
    <p>
        My general idea with this proyect is to create different classes
        that are more distinc from one another and have their own way to play.
